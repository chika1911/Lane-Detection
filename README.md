# Lane-Detection
lane detection using hough transformation

This project focuses on developing a lane detection system using computer vision techniques, specifically Canny edge detection, Hough transformation, perspective transform, and gamma correction. The goal is to accurately identify and track lane markings on the road, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, driver assistance systems, and lane departure warning.
